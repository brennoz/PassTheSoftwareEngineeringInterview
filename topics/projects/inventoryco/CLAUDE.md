## Verified Facts

- **Datastore: MariaDB only.** The original suggested `docker-compose.yml` offered MongoDB,
  MariaDB, and OpenSearch + Dashboards as options. The solution kept MariaDB only. MongoDB,
  OpenSearch, and OpenSearch Dashboards were present in the original suggested stack and were
  removed. Kafka and Redis were never part of the original stack at all — they don't appear
  anywhere in it. There is no Kafka or Redis anywhere in the actual build — any mention of them
  in pages 0010/0011 is explicitly a counterfactual ("what if"), not a description of what was
  built.
- **Frame IDs are immutable.** `Frame.frameId` is `@Column(..., updatable = false)`. Create
  rejects a duplicate ID (`DuplicateFrameException`); update never changes it.
- **Optimistic locking via JPA `@Version`** (a `long` column named `version`). Clients must
  send back the version they read; a stale write throws
  `ObjectOptimisticLockingFailureException`, caught and rethrown as
  `StaleFrameVersionException` → HTTP `409 Conflict`.
- **Audit actors are fixed strings**, not real identities (no auth is implemented): manual
  writes use `"demo-user"`, CSV-imported writes use `"csv-import"`. Both are literal constants
  in `FrameCommandService`.
- **CSV import bounds:** max 5,000 data rows, 2 MB file size, at most 100 detailed row errors
  returned (total failed count is still accurate even when truncated). Each row is upserted in
  its own `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW)` call — one bad row never rolls back a
  good one, and the import is deliberately **not** parallelized across virtual threads (ADR
  0002 explains why: 1,000-row files don't justify the added nondeterminism).
  CSV parsing uses Apache Commons CSV (`CSVFormat.RFC4180`), header-name mapping, duplicate
  headers disallowed.
- **Revisions only exist for actual changes.** `Frame.update()` computes a diff first
  (`FrameData.changesFrom()`); if the diff is empty, no revision row is written, even though
  the request was technically an "update" call.
- **Search is SQL LIKE-based**, not full-text or fuzzy. `FrameSpecifications.matching()` builds
  a JPA `Specification` that OR's a case-insensitive LIKE across 7 fields (frameId, siteNumber,
  station, address, town, postcode, format), with manual escaping of `%`, `_`, and `\` in the
  user's query to prevent LIKE-wildcard injection. Status/environment/mediaType are exact-match
  filters, not text search.
- **Entire (the required checkpoint-capture CLI) failed to capture anything.** Zero checkpoints
  exist on `main`; the Codex hooks were never trusted during the actual working session. This
  is a real, documented gap — write about it honestly in page 0012, not glossed over. The
  `implementation-journal.md` is the reconstructed substitute record, built from git history and
  visible conversation milestones, not a verbatim session transcript.
- **Testing:** backend tests use Testcontainers against a real MariaDB (not H2/mocks) for the
  highest-risk cross-layer behavior; focused unit tests were added later for CSV import
  safeguards and frontend forms. No browser-automation suite — out of scope for the one-day
  timebox (this is stated directly in the README's "Current limitations" section).

## Document Rules

### Snippet accuracy
Every `.snippet` block's code must be copy-pasted from the actual file, not reconstructed from
memory or from this CLAUDE.md's prose. Re-read the source file with the Read tool immediately
before writing a snippet and use its real current line numbers in the label.

### No Kafka/OpenSearch/Redis claims outside pages 0010-0011
Pages 0001-0009 and 0012 describe what was actually built. Do not describe OpenSearch, Kafka,
Redis, or MongoDB as being used anywhere in those pages. MongoDB and OpenSearch were present in
the original suggested stack and were removed; Kafka and Redis were never present in the
original stack at all. Pages 0010 and 0011 are explicitly counterfactual and should be clearly
framed as "if we had chosen X instead."

### Actor strings
Always write the literal strings `demo-user` and `csv-import` (in code font) when referring to
audit actors — never invent a different placeholder name.
