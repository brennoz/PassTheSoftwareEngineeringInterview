// Java: records can have methods in their body — they just cannot have mutable instance fields.
//       amount() is a custom accessor that delegates to subscription.amount().
// WHY amount() on Invoice: avoids callers writing invoice.subscription().amount() everywhere.
//     Encapsulates the navigation path. If the model changes, only this one method changes.
